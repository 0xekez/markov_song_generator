Photoshop the ground, just you can find our culture 
founded from a pair and get back crack open 
to change the money I'd be cool.

Here is that?  
And Los Angeles went and the vogues, 
too mustard and some drug abuse

I was seven years as I was gay 
remind me husband and religion gender
something bruised my life wasted ten thousand hands,
they say I know what we had a millions (millions) headed up.

hey! 
can be an example of a cold hand 
I'm headed in my job off of 
and r out that's right! 

feels party mountain, 
some house slippers dookie ropes on we go hard to friends
couldn't tell her less conscious than succeed at night

Melting tombs open, 
awake for my bed instead of crime  
[2x:] 
sounds of my tints (nuh uh) but I was the backpack.

Conservatives think that you my time
I wear war paint, fight that I can't change us 
then gives me something else if I bought

It's got the vibe of starting over
[verse 2 â€” allen stone:]
underneath this is patient
not crying on the twenty-something confusion.


GENERATED CHANCE THE RAPPER - SRC: COLORING BOOK

Do shit
you came out music
music all we dont do is better 
love you
yeah, I speak noble things as soft as the blessings on concrete, 
jolly rancher kids

I used to pick up right back
I been drinking all night, I see the beauty supply
blockbuster movies and prayed and tribulations that even let my woes up, the water
I gave her percs for me, how great is everything

war with friends
summer dont, we got a hat, that's true name to laugh the blunt
all night, hey
all night, I been drinking, ay ay
all night, I been drinking all night

I might as friends
labels told my shooters come down
it down on my crib like the rapper
you buy a juke jam
we smoked to losing students
but when the same drugs no problems with me
only nigga still play ball, ayy
all night

Between blessings and worldly possessions
like her momma
cant see the blessings come down
the carter, niggas in the best friend
fucked all we used.

I used to pray, like shhh
chance the words
this money, aint no shine no problems, want no problems, want no more
we said the streets, say
so put your mountain, hallelujah
so much history baby mommas
my niggas toss they ship.

Glorify this pavement.
The up, on but it wander, the obvious that the vibe,
is party, prayings and hectic
and blessings.

My monumentally, towards all a detox 
I escape, that wyoming
my velcros
and solace the non-profit that drums
a otherside. 

That's to overdosin,
to soulful know my degree,
I idris ground,
bombin her I tight
I movies that fables
I get mask

the puff I hometown
speed on
to did to eye
that blow, back the nod all a jack
and anyways

glasses, on you trip
grab at the maco
I up, can through to drug-dealing know a testing helping a inadequate
gods my hieroglyphics, sing?
Need my hustler
