# Markov Song Generator
Generates song lyrics based on artists' lyrics using markov chains. 

Includes a script to scrape songs lyrics from azlyrics, but don't use it. It is probably not the most legal nor ethical thing to do. 

Some example songs this thing has put out with some very light formatting cleanup can be found in the example songs file. 

Example:

```
GENERATED CHANCE THE RAPPER - SRC: COLORING BOOK

Do shit
you came out music
music all we dont do is better 
love you
yeah, I speak noble things as soft as the blessings on concrete, 
jolly rancher kids

I used to pick up right back
I been drinking all night, I see the beauty supply
blockbuster movies and prayed and tribulations that even let my woes up, the water
I gave her percs for me, how great is everything

war with friends
summer dont, we got a hat, that's true name to laugh the blunt
all night, hey
all night, I been drinking, ay ay
all night, I been drinking all night

I might as friends
labels told my shooters come down
it down on my crib like the rapper
you buy a juke jam
we smoked to losing students
but when the same drugs no problems with me
only nigga still play ball, ayy
all night

Between blessings and worldly possessions
like her momma
cant see the blessings come down
the carter, niggas in the best friend
fucked all we used.

I used to pray, like shhh
chance the words
this money, aint no shine no problems, want no problems, want no more
we said the streets, say
so put your mountain, hallelujah
so much history baby mommas
my niggas toss they ship.
